My name is J. Gergely Hornyak, currently graduating from Coventry University, as a MSci CompSci student. I am an open-source enthusiast, therefore:

- Iâ€™m involved in a Daily Poll app depeloped by myself for group of friends,
- Every year I participate the Advent of Code competition.
- In my free time, I create animations in Blender, and start small projects like:
  -  Particle simulation - inspired by Particle Life,
  -  Online Multiplayer Web-based game,
  -  Black hole rendering software written in C++ and Cuda - as part of University project.
