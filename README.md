# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, 

Iâ€™m Gergely Hornyak, a Computer Science MSc graduate from Coventry University. I use GitHub mainly to share my hobbies, experiments, and projects that keep me curious and learning. I am an open-source enthusiast programmer, looking for opportunities to expand the community of OSS.

- ðŸš€ Iâ€™m building a Daily Poll app for a group of friends.
- ðŸŽ„ Every year, I take part in the Advent of Code competition.
- ðŸŽ¨ In my free time, I enjoy making Blender animations and model showcases.
- I usually start tinkering with small projects like:
  - ðŸŒ€ A particle simulation inspired by Particle Life,
  - ðŸŽ® An online multiplayer web game,
  - ðŸŒŒ A black hole renderer in C++ and CUDA (my MSc project).

ðŸ’» Confident in Python, JavaScript, and Node.js, and always exploring new tools and technologies.

ðŸŒ± A continuous learner who loves experimenting, creating, and sharing ideas with the community.

I believe in thinking outside the box, staying open-minded, and using creativity to turn small ideas into fun and meaningful projects. 

My GitHub is a mix of experiments, personal projects, and open-source collabs â€” feel free to explore or connect with me on [https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-gergely-hornyak](LinkedIn) !
